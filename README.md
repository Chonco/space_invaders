# space_invaders
Retro arcade game Space Inviders but with my own graphical methods.

No special configuration is required in order to run the project.

If you have some issues with performance or the difficulty isn't the one 
desired, I would suggest some tinkering on GameConstants.java file, variables:
PROJECTILE_MOVEMENT & ALIEN_SHOOTS_EVERY, and N_ITERATION_ALIENS_MOVES var 
and updateAlienSpeed method, both on Game.java file
